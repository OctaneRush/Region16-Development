## Welcome to the Final Project in CIDM 4390
# Our team members include:
# Barek, Logan, Zach, and Brittany
# Green Team's SCRUM Guide to Success:

### (key: _Italicized_is taken directly from Dr.Babb)

## Sprint time allotment: 40 hours over two weeks. Initially 40 points with a desire to increase/grow. The points/hours a sprint as defined.

## This document will provide knowledge, direction, and resources for maintaining and delivering potentially shippable products through every sprint cycle. In an AGILE manner, we seek to increase efficiency, design correctly, providing the utmost value to the stakeholders in this project. Using the &quot;Daily SCRUM/Standup&quot; communicating with transparency, inspecting each other carefully, and adapting to impediments we will provide potentially shippable products per sprint. This document will be used as a guide for the team, a measure of success of the process, and a social contract of accountability to ourselves, teammates, product manager, SCRUM Master, and product owner/stakeholder.

## The following information is sourced Rubin&#39;s SCRUM and Synthesis of Rubin SCRUM from Dr. Babb. Any further clarification should be sought through re-reading and analysis of the source material and teammates' input.

## Not following this guide seeks impedes the success of all involved.

## Tools we are using: Microsoft Azure Devops for version control, team management, and transparency to the Product Manager. Shell used moving forward will be Unix-based.

# Roles:

## SCRUM Master —Barek Bentley

## Product Owner – Mary Bralley

## Project Manager – Dr. Babb

## Full Development Members: Brittany MacKeown, Zachary Younggren

## Benevolent Dictator – Logan Jones

## Lesser Development Members –Barek Bentley, Logan Jones

### SCRUM Master responsibilities: maintaining and ensuring SCRUM is adhered to, Documenting Daily SCRUMs, working as a liaison between the Product Owner and Development team when conflicts of interest arise.

### Full Development Members: Seek to work on Product Backlog items in an effort to make potentially shippable products while meeting story points. Seek to improve velocity such that, x-story points/hours steadily increase to a positive delta.

### Benevolent Dictator: Establishes the version of code in the Main branch to reduce merge conflicts and provide the best potentially shippable product per sprint.

### Lesser Development Members: These members must utilize their story points towards tasks such as planning and version control as the SCRUM Master and Benevolent Dictator. Therefore, there is initially a lesser initial velocity than Full Development Members. All the while with the expectation of contributing to overall personal positive deltas and the overall positive team delta.

## Sprints will take in a 2-week period.

### The following are the sprint intervals:

#### 3-21 --- 4-3

#### 4-4 --- 4-17

#### 4-18 --- 5-2

![SCRUM Process Diagram](/images/SCRUM.png)

## Sprint Planning will take place every **Tuesday evening (3/23, 3/30, 4/5, 4/12, 4/19)** after Inspection/Review and Retrospective (taking place the previous Monday elaborated on later) Maximum of two hours, aim for fewer hours towards the 10 hours each of us have.

# Sprint Planning

### _Backlog Grooming – ONLY DO THIS WHEN YOU DECIDE A PBI WILL BE USED FOR THIS SPRINT_

## _a. Create/Specify PBIs_

![Invest definition](/images/Invest.png)

### _i. Review the User Story to ensure that the_ [_INVEST_](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/) _principles are applied to that_

### _story_ ![](RackMultipart20220313-4-xdrkj1_html_55151116d455cfd7.png)

### SCRUM Master will check for each

### _ii. Generate acceptance criteria that specify the conditions of satisfaction using the_

### _iii. Be mindful of the need for knowledge acquisition stories_

### SCRUM Master will seek out the need of KA for each development member and look to assign accordingly

## _b. Estimate PBIs_

### Estimation will take place with planning poker using Fibonacci sequence. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

## _c. Prioritize PBIs_

### Priority will be determined through the desire to meet Product Managers requests and Expected weekly schedule of team members. We will focusing on &quot;Building it right&quot; over &quot;building the right thing&quot; some PBIs, will be in EPICs, others will be in future releasees, and most pressing items will be put first with SCRUM Master and Product Managers direction. Again, consider AGILE INVEST principles.

## _Establish a definition of ready for the Sprint (Table 6.2)_

### 1. Team Green's Definition of Ready will include:

#### 1. Benevolent Dictator has approved the Main branch
#### 2. Impediments have been expressed and addressed
#### 3. Each Member can see their items to work on in Azure DevOps
#### 4. Each Member understands the definition of done and no previous PBI is impeding forward movement

## _3. Identify a Sprint Goal (must come from the Product Owner / Professor)_

### Sprint Goal expressed from Product Owner/ Professor is written in Azure DevOps and Team has agreed to meet that goal. If Team feels the goal is too difficult SCRUM Master will negotiate on behalf of development team with the Product Owner/ Professor about adjusting expectations.

## _4. Establish a definition of done for the Sprint (Table 4.1)_

![Done Definition](/images/Figure3.png)

### SCRUM Master will be responsible for documenting and updating the definition of Done in Azure DevOps. It will be modeled after the example of above looking similar to the following:

#### 1. Code has been approved by Benevolent Dictator to be put in Main Branch
#### 2. Team inspection has taken place and equally agreed the PBI is done
#### 3. Necessary Documentation/Commenting of code has taken place and further documentation for end user is given to a separate PBI
#### 4. Testing has taken place, especially written first with TDD.
#### 5. Zero Known Defects.

##### Note: Definition of &quot;Done&quot; will shorter than a corporate environment as to progress in the short sprints more successfully.

## _5. Follow either:_

### _a. The two-part sprint planning process (Table 19.3)_

![Figure 19.3](/images/Figure19.3.png)

### SCRUM Master will organize the question flow during planning after planning poker is complete and update according in AzureDevops.

## _6. Ensure that your team capacity accommodates all relevant factors (Figure 19.5)_

![Figure 19.5](/images/Figure19.5.png)

### Team members will express to the SCRUM Master their understanding :

### their expected Sprint buffer,

### capacity to work on product backlog items selected

## Impediments from other classes, Knowingly accounting for SCRUM (non-sprint) activities

# The expected hour commitment is set at 10 hours a sprint.

## _7. Use story points to estimate PBI/Feature capacity_

### Story points are assigned through Fibonacci sequence.

## _8. Use effort hours to estimate task capacity (Table 19.2)_

![PBI](/images/PBI.png)

### SCRUM Master will fill out a team sprint excel sheet to facilitate this information in the meeting discussion as well as update it in Azure DevOps other members are expected to provide their best

## _9. Create a PBI and Task Plan (Figure 19.6)_

![Sprint Backlog](/images/SprintBacklog.png)

### SCRUM Master will use Excel and DevOps to organize and track this information. SCRUM Master will follow the discussion and pull information from members.

## _10. Take impediments and knowledge acquisition into account_

### In each of these sprints, there will be a minimum of 4 daily SCRUMs.

## Daily SCRUM will be no longer than 15 minutes. Recorded and pushed to the VCS by the SCRUM Master. These will take place every: **Thursday evening (3/24, 3/31, 4/7, 4/14, 4/21, 4/28)**  **and every** **Saturday Morning (3/26, 4/2, 4/9, 4/16, 4/23, 4/30)**

## Synthesis from Dr.Babb:

### _1. Conduct Daily Scrum – Record these meetings as I will not likely attend them_

### _2. These meetings are time-boxed to not last longer than 15 minutes_

### _3. You present the following and ALWAYS show evidence of work_

#### _a. What have I accomplished since the last daily scrum (ALWAYS SHOW CODE)_

#### Only committed code will be considered &quot;shown&quot;

#### Benevolent Dictator will check to see if code should be merged to Main Branch

#### _b. What I will be working on between now and the next daily scrum_

#### Directly Messaged to SCRUM Master in Slack to update in Azure Devops

#### _c. What impediments I am have encountered_

#### Directly Messaged to SCRUM Master in Slack to update in Azure Devops

#### SCRUM Master will also seek resolutions to overcome impediments next sprint. Resources will be given after meeting ~a day of finding answers.

#### _4. Maintain a Task Board (use either AzureDevops or something simpler, like a spreadsheet) – see_

#### _Figure 20.6._

#### The SCRUM Master should seek a majority of maintenance and design within Azure Devops accurately representing the Task Board as accurately as possible within a 12-hour delay/window.

![Example Task Board](/images/ExampleTaskBoard.png)

#### _5. Maintain a sprint burndown chart and review it at each daily scrum. See Table 20.1, Figures 20.7_

#### _and 20.8_

#### Azure DevOps can generate reports, but the SCRUM Master will also manage a copy of this in a shared excel file.

![Burndown Chart](/images/BurndownChart.png)

#### _ **a** __**. Alternatively, you can maintain a Burnup Chart (see figure 20.9)**_

#### **Sprint Review –** will take place every **other Monday (4/4, 4/18, 5/2)** after class at the end of the sprint.

#### _1. Ensure that you have met the definition of done._

#### a. Have tangible proof that we met the definition of done (commits, recordings, etc.)

#### _2. Say (out loud) what the Sprint Goal was for the sprint under review._

#### a. Did the team, collectively, keep the same priorities regarding the Sprint Goal?

#### b. Each team member must agree that the goal was met in order to achieve unity and consistency.

#### _3. Mention the features/PBIs that contributed to the shaping the goal._

#### a. Ensure that documentation from the SCRUM Master is accurate and complete.

#### _4. Demonstrate the product increment such that the acceptance criteria/conditions of satisfaction are demonstrated (NOT TOLD)._

#### _5. Review that the demonstrated work meets the definition of done._

#### _6. Discuss the product increment such that a new sprint goal can be established._

#### a. Did the completed goal meet the prerequisites for the next Sprint Goal?

#### b. Will the accomplished goal hinder the completion of the next goal?

#### **Sprint Retrospective –** will take place every other **Monday evening** **(4/4, 4/18, 5/2)**.

#### _1. This event is designed to facilitate the continuous improvement of the team and MUST NOT BE SKIPPED or SKIMPED_

#### _2. Matters to discuss:_EVERY MEMBER Will share on these matters. Write them down for SCRUM Master to track and update.

#### _a. &quot;What worked well this sprint that we want to continue doing?&quot;_

#### _b. &quot;What didn&#39;t work well this sprint that we want to stop doing?&quot;_

#### _c. &quot;What should we start doing or improving?&quot;_

#### _3. All must participate and answer the questions_

#### _4. Identify insights for improvement actions_

#### _5. Track these improvement efforts in an Insight Backlog (this is a list of ideas/actions for improvement)_

### SCRUM Master will track this Excel and DevOps accordingly

#### _6. Ensure that at least one insight action item is attempted per sprint_

#### Establishing how we will continue to increase our Delta and Velocity. We will write it down and review last insight action item results.

### SCRUM Master Personal Statement – I as SCRUM Master seek to guide my development team to a success understanding and application of AGILE SCRUM principles to continue deliver potentially shippable products each sprint I understand the responsibility placed on me and how it is necessary for the success of my team members.

### Benevolent Dictator Personal Statement – I as Benevolent Dictator will ensure that the potentially shippable product meets the definition of done through resolving merge conflicts, ensuring clean and well documented code, and aligning with the SOLID Principles.

### Development Member (Brittany MacKeown) Personal Statement -- I as the Development Member will ensure that the code developed code is a good approximation of a shippable product: coded well and with the end user and product owner in mind, aligning with SOLID principles, even before the Benevolent Dictator looks over the written code.

### Development Member Personal Statement (Zach) Development Member Personal Statement -- I as a Full Development Member will work on and complete coding items in order to complete story points along the way to completing a finished product, while also working on methods to reduce the amount of time future story points will take to complete.
